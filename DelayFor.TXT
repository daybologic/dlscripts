DelayFor
--------
Suspends batch execution

From inside a batch file the programmer has no time delay pause,
to correct this make sure this program is on the path and use as
follows:

DELAYFOR <milliseconds>

milliseconds are 1/1000 / sec, therefore to delay for 2.5 seconds
calculate 2.5 * 1000 and use the following:

DELAYFOR 2500

The interval that follows is not interruptable, the user cannot
press a key to cut-short the waiting time.  Don't over do it
because the user will resent you and don't use a value greater
than 65,535 because it will over-run eg. 65,357 = 2.

So 65.535 secs is the maximum waiting time.
