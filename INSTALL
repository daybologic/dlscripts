In order to install dlscripts, you will need Perl.
This is sensible as the majority of the scripts therein are written in
Perl anyway!  Just type:

./install.sh

If you want to choose where the scripts will be installed yourself,
type

./install.sh -i

which will pause to ask you questions during the installation.
